We are excited to announce a partnership between Standard Analytics
and [Science Exchange]( https://www.scienceexchange.com) around the
[Reproducibility Initiative](https://www.scienceexchange.com/reproducibility).

The pressure to ensure the reproducibility of published science
[is](http://articles.latimes.com/2013/oct/27/business/la-fi-hiltzik-20131027)

[and](http://www.forbes.com/sites/brucebooth/2012/09/26/scientific-reproducibility-begleys-six-rules)
[increasing](http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21588057-scientists-think-science-self-correcting-alarming-degree-it-not-trouble):

- [47 of 53 landmark oncology publications were not reproducible](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v483/n7391/full/483531a.html)
- [only 25% of published preclinical studies could be validated](http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v10/n9/full/nrd3439-c1.html)
- [of 432 publications in hypertension, multiple sclerosis or lung cancer claiming differences in risk for men versus women, **only one** was reproducible](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=208562).

The Reproducibility Initiative is a collaborative effort, including
[Science Exchange](https://www.scienceexchange.com),
[PLOS](http://www.plos.org/), [FigShare](http://figshare.com/), and
[Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com/), to provide a forum for the independent validation of published studies.  The initiative recently received a $1.3 million grant
from the
[Laura and John Arnold Foundation](http://www.arnoldfoundation.org/)
to launch a project to validate [50 of the landmark studies in cancer biology](
https://osf.io/p7ayb/wiki/home/).

Standard Analytics' mission in this partnership is perfectly
summarized by this commentary by Prof. David Vaux published in
[Nature](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v492/n7428/full/492180a.html),

>Numerical data should be made available either as part of the paper
>or as linked, computer-interpretable files so that readers can
>perform or confirm statistical analyses themselves.
 
Over the coming months, we will work hard to ensure that all data and
analytics from both the original studies and the reproduced ones can be
fully reproduced and made available in the best possible formats so
that scientist can keep challenging and building upon this work.

After our work is done, reproducing and challenging any study from
the reproducibility initiative will be as easy as:
