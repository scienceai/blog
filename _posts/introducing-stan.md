We are thrilled to announce the launch of Standard Analytics IO,
("[STAN](http://www.wpclipart.com/animals/S/sloth/Sloth_drawing.png)") and we're glad you found
us. Welcome! As data-scientists and former academic researchers, we
understand first-hand that
[horrible feeling](https://24.media.tumblr.com/ed476620ab8efbb04bcd5907f4a36065/tumblr_mxsvdkIVHj1szhmd5o1_500.gif)
when you've found a great published paper or blog post with a cool
analysis or maybe some data you want to include in your own work but
it doesn't come with the original data, yet alone the code to run the
analysis and even after emailing the original author, it takes months
to hear back, if you're lucky. It's no wonder that we re-invent the
wheel all the time.  And while unfortunate, it's not horribly
surprising that science is hard to reproduce - so much so that we're
facing a full-blown
'[reproducibility crisis](http://www.nature.com/news/replication-studies-bad-copy-1.10634)'
in science right now.  Without a system to organize and keep track of
the moving parts that make up any scientific project, it's incredibly
challenging to even re-use your own work, nevermind someone
else's work! We are passionate about making it easy for people to
collaborate and share the amazing work that they are doing. In short, we
are working to give you
*[the science you want, in the format you need](http://standardanalytics.io)*.

Rather than tell you what we do, we want to *show* you what we do with
real examples from scientific papers in fields from experimental
psychology to cancer biology and blog posts on startups, statistics,
and more, so stay tuned...
